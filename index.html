            My name is Kamin Punjarojanakul, and I am a junior at Stony Brook University, studying Computer Science. I grew up in Jackson Heights, Queens and resided there until 6th grade.  We then moved to Westbury, Long Island, where my family still lives.  I enjoy working out, playing basketball and  video games.  Iâ€™ve always had a strong interest and fascination with computer programming.  Despite having no practical programming experience, I wanted to challenge myself, so I decided to try out Computer Science.  In spite of some early struggles-which I overcame through increased study time and extra work, I eventually became succcesful with my chosen major.  The main language I'm comfortable in is Java. I'm currently learning web development as well as Swift, for mobile app development.  </p>
